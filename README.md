# Twangular

### A Twitter keyword search using AngularJS

To implement you will need to provide a search source in app/js/controllers.js 

For instance: $scope.url = 'http://example.com/twitter/search?q=';

NOTE: The test for formatDate filter assumes the tester is in EST. Adjust according to your location.
